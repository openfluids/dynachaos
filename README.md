## Why dynachaos?

dynachaos is a reusable Python/Rust package for inspecting simulated or
measured dynamical-systems time signals. It collects maps, coupled-map
lattices, recurrence analysis, entropy diagnostics, Grassberger-Procaccia
correlation dimension, multifractal spectra, and reproducible analysis
pipelines in one codebase. Performance-sensitive kernels use Rust backends
where they have parity tests, while pure-Python fallbacks support portability
and reference checks.

## Features

**Maps** — logistic, circle, coupled logistic, delayed logistic, coupled
delayed, modulated circle, torus doubling (Map I / Map IV)

**Coupled Map Lattices** — CML with nearest-neighbor diffusive coupling,
globally coupled maps (GCM), pattern dynamics, cluster statistics

**Diagnostics** — Lyapunov exponents (1D + QR spectrum + flow systems),
0-1 test for chaos, SALI/GALI alignment indices, permutation entropy +
complexity-entropy planes, sample/approximate/fuzzy/multiscale entropy,
recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), Grassberger-Procaccia
correlation dimension, multifractal spectra ($D_q$, $f(\alpha)$),
AMI + Cao + FNN embedding

**Rust backends** — correlation integral (Grassberger-Procaccia), fuzzy
entropy sum, recurrence line extraction, ordinal distribution counting,
AMI histograms, Cao dimension selection, multifractal moments

**Visualization** — bifurcation diagrams, cobweb plots, return maps,
curated Swiss-inspired style themes

## Quick Start

From a fresh checkout, run the tested external-signal workflow recipe:

```bash
uv run dynachaos analyze examples/recipes/external_signal/external_signal_recipe.jsonc
```

The command writes
`examples/recipes/external_signal/outputs/external_signal_recipe/results.json`,
`examples/recipes/external_signal/outputs/external_signal_recipe/metadata.json`,
and
`examples/recipes/external_signal/outputs/external_signal_recipe/summary.md`.
It is intentionally small so it can run as a smoke test; use the recipe gallery
for the long-signal streaming example.

## Config-driven signal analysis workflow

Run scalar/reduced time-series analyses with a JSONC config; all tuning lives in
the config, not CLI flags.

Config schema summary:
- `input`: either `{ "path": "signal.npy" }` / `{ "path": "signal.npz", "npz_key": "x" }` for a 1D finite scalar/reduced signal, or `{ "generated": { "name": "logistic", "n": 1000, "seed": 0 } }` for self-contained runs.
- `output.dir`: stable output directory, resolved relative to the config file.
- `diagnostics`: list of `{ "name": ... }` entries. Supported workflow names are `permutation_entropy`, `correlation_dimension`, `rqa_streaming`, and `rqa_dense`.
- `scale_limits`: optional dense-RQA guard; `dense_rqa_max_bytes` defaults to 4 GiB using the `8*N^2` distance-matrix envelope, and `allow_dense_rqa_beyond_envelope: true` is required to override it.

Output layout is stable and referenceable by path: `results.json`
(machine-readable diagnostic values), `metadata.json` (N, shape, wall time in
seconds, peak RSS in MB, and per-diagnostic `ReliabilityRecord` metadata), and
`summary.md` (human-readable report with relative artifact names). Reliability
metadata records backend, parameters, data shape, sampling/downsampling notes,
warnings, unresolved verdicts, and scale evidence. It helps you decide how much
scientific confidence to place in a number; it is not an automatic pass/fail
certificate.

For long-signal local RQA, avoid dense recurrence matrices and set an explicit
threshold in config:

```jsonc
{
  "input": {"path": "long_signal.npy"},
  "output": {"dir": "results/long_signal_rqa"},
  "diagnostics": [
    {"name": "rqa_streaming", "embedding": {"d": 3, "tau": 2}, "eps": 0.08, "l_min": 2, "v_min": 2}
  ]
}
```

The local/full-run command `uv run dynachaos analyze long_signal_rqa.jsonc`
requires a local `long_signal_rqa.jsonc` file and the `long_signal.npy` input it
names. The tested commands live in the quickstart and in `examples/README.md`.

## Rust-Accelerated Backends

Performance-critical algorithms are implemented as Rust kernels. The Rust
extension is required by default: `import dynachaos` fails loudly if it has not
been built.

Build the extension in editable mode:

```bash
uv run maturin develop --release
```

### Pure-Python fallback policy

The Rust kernels are the intended path for production-sized all-pairs and
large-N diagnostics. Pure-Python paths are an explicit opt-in for parity testing
and portability, not an automatic silent fallback. Set `DYNACHAOS_NO_RUST=1`
when you need to exercise them; the test suite checks parity on representative
small workloads. Some fallback implementations remain exact and quadratic by
design, so large pure-Python runs should be treated as diagnostic or development
runs unless a future release explicitly makes large fallback performance a
target.

### Correlation integral (Grassberger-Procaccia)

The all-pairs kernel evaluates all N(N−1)/2 pairs with Theiler-window
exclusion and multi-radius binning in a single pass.
The implementation is designed for correctness and low memory use,
offering several advantages over common baseline scripts (e.g., [notsebastiano/GP_algorithm](https://github.com/notsebastiano/GP_algorithm/blob/master/GP_algorithm.py)):

- **Algorithmic Correctness** — Supports the **Theiler window** ($|i-j| > w$) to
  exclude temporally correlated pairs (Theiler 1986) and uses proper
  normalization ($C(r) \le 1$).
- **Scaling Region Detection** — Employs a **stable plateau search** on local
  slopes instead of simple heuristics, making it robust to noise and saturation.
- **Memory Efficiency** — Uses **O(1) auxiliary memory** per pair (streaming)
  instead of an $O(N^2)$ distance matrix.

The Rust kernel uses:

- **Raw slice indexing** — C-contiguous slice access, avoiding ndarray's
  per-index `Index` overhead while staying in safe Rust
- **Prefix-sum binning** — one write per pair instead of up to 50;
  converted to cumulative counts with a single O(n_r) pass after the loop
- **Squared-distance comparison** — pre-squared thresholds eliminate
  `sqrt()` in Euclidean mode (saves 10–20 cycles per pair)
- **Branch-separated loops** — Chebyshev and Euclidean paths are fully
  separated, enabling independent auto-vectorization
- **Rayon parallelism** — outer loop distributed across all cores via
  Rayon; GIL released with `py.detach()` before the parallel region
- **Native compiler optimization** — release builds can use the local CPU
  target configured under `.cargo/`.

Benchmark numbers should be regenerated on the release target hardware before
being used in public documentation.

### Fuzzy entropy sum

Computes Σ exp(−(d/r)ⁿ) over all upper-triangle pairs on mean-centered
templates, using the same Rayon parallel fold + reduce pattern.

| Cao's method | `diagnostics.embedding` | dimension selector only | Cao 1997 |

`diagnostics.recurrence` keeps `recurrence_matrix()` for callers that need the
binary matrix. For large trajectories where only scalar RQA measures are needed,
use `rqa_from_trajectory()` to avoid materializing the dense recurrence matrix.
When starting from an existing recurrence matrix, compute public RQA metrics
through `rqa()`, which validates that the matrix is non-empty, square, and
symmetric. The direct line extractors, including the Rust-accelerated helpers,
are lower-level square-matrix scanners and do not replace that public RQA
validation boundary.

## Reproduction gallery

The `figures/` tree holds a section-indexed set of reproductions of Kunihiko
Kaneko's published work on circle maps, torus doubling, fractalization,
coupled map lattices, and globally coupled maps. Each section is regenerated
from scratch by the same public entry points users call:

```bash
dynachaos list
dynachaos run sec02_circle_map
dynachaos run all
```

The committed `.npz` caches double as golden data for the reproducibility and
determinism tests, so the gallery is both a worked example and a standing
regression check. It is a demanding stress test of the package rather than its
boundary: for general use on your own signals, see the quickstart and recipe
gallery above.

## Benchmarks

The reproducible scale-envelope benchmark for Rust Grassberger-Procaccia parity
and dense recurrence/RQA memory limits lives in `benchmarks/scale_envelope.py`.
The local benchmark command is
`uv run python benchmarks/scale_envelope.py benchmarks/scale_envelope.jsonc`;
inspect `benchmarks/results/scale_envelope.{json,md}` after it runs. The
checked artifact reports a 42.95x CI-mode Rust Grassberger-Procaccia speedup at
N=1000 for the largest common logistic case, and a dense-RQA predicted
distance-matrix envelope of 8*N^2 bytes (impracticality threshold N≈23170 at
4 GiB). The measured Rust acceleration roadmap and local hotspot profiler are
documented in `docs/rust-acceleration-roadmap.md` and
`benchmarks/rust_hotspot_profile.py`.
