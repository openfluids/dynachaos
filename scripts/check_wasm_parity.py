"""Check that the WebAssembly build computes what the native build computes.

Both sides evaluate the same fixed tile of the sine circle map and print the
raw bit pattern of every value, so a one-bit disagreement cannot hide behind a
decimal formatter.

The two builds cannot be bit-identical everywhere, and the reason is physical
rather than a defect. Measured on 2026-09-08 over a 64 x 64 tile:

* Native Rust and NumPy agree on all 4096 cells, exactly. Both call the
  platform sine.
* The WebAssembly build calls the sine that Rust compiles into the module.
  It differs from the platform one by about one unit in the last place.
* Below the critical line ``K = 1 / (2 * pi)``, about 0.159, that stays one
  unit in the last place: 2 cells differed, by at most 7.8e-16.
* Above it the map is no longer invertible and the orbit is chaotic, so the
  same one-bit difference grows over 700 iterations: 15 of 1920 cells differed,
  13 of them by more than the ``1e-12`` floor below, by up to 2.9e-2. That 13
  is the number this script prints.

The check classifies each native cell by how the kernel stopped (locked,
display-stop, or exhausted) and applies a separate bound per population. Locked
cells stay on the subcritical limit at any K. Display-stop cells are held to one
colour step (1/256) at any K. Exhausted cells below the critical line stay on
the subcritical limit; exhausted cells above it keep the chaotic noise floor
and share limit.

Do not loosen the subcritical bound to make this pass. A difference there means
the browser computes something the paper did not.

The native side is built WITHOUT ``-C target-cpu=native``. The repository sets
that flag for local builds, and it lets the compiler fuse a multiply and an add
into a single instruction that ``wasm32`` has no equivalent for. Comparing a
natively tuned build against the browser build would measure the compiler
rather than the port.
