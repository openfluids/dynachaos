//! Browser surface over the dynachaos kernels.
//!
//! Every export here obeys the contract in `docs/wasm-architecture.md`, which
//! exists because a web page is a hostile caller: its arguments arrive from a
//! slider, a URL or a stranger.
//!
//! 1. Clamp every input into a documented range. Never trust, never reject.
//! 2. Cap every loop. A frozen tab is worse than a coarse picture.
//! 3. Return one flat `Vec<f64>` whose layout is written in the doc comment.
//!
//! The kernels themselves live in `dynachaos-core` and are the same code the
//! published figures were computed with. This crate only converts and guards.
//! Fourteen exports: `rotation_number_tile` for the picture,
//! `rotation_number_point` for the quoted readout, `zero_one_k` for the
//! 0-1 test for chaos, `correlation_counts`, `apen_counts`,
//! `fuzzy_entropy_sum`, `ordinal_distribution`, `diagonal_lines`,
//! `vertical_lines`, `multifractal_moments`, `ami_histogram` and
//! `select_dimension_cao` for the diagnostics panel, and
//! `delayed_logistic_attractor_tile` and `torus_doubling_attractor_tile`
//! for the map-attractor live figures.
